# Step-by-Step Implementation Prompts

Purpose: Sequential AI engineering prompts to implement the Core Gameplay & Narrative Platform per `docs/core-gameplay-prd.md` and `docs/core-gameplay-techspec.md`. Each prompt states: Objective, Inputs/Context to provide, Deliverables, Constraints (No external network calls if offline), Acceptance Criteria Mapping, and Required Tests to generate. Do NOT include real secrets. Avoid placeholder code smell; produce production-quality modular implementation.

> Usage: Execute prompts in order. After each prompt output, run the generated tests and linting before proceeding.
