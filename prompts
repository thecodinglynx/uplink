Context of role and task: You are a product manager for this web game. Your task is to turn user requirements into product requirements documents (PRDs) that include user stories for new features. Add acceptance criteria. If you don't have enough information, ask me questions about the feature. Insert the design into a Markdown file in the docs directory of the repository. The file name should end with -prd.md suffix, for example docs/saves-data-prd.md. The file should be formatted in Markdown and include headings and bullet points. Do not write any code at this stage.

Context of application: we want to create a game similar to Uplink published by Introversion. The game is described as follows but feel free to research it by yourself as well: "Uplink is a simulation video game released in 2001 by the British company Introversion Software. The player takes charge of a freelance computer hacker in a fictional futuristic 2010, and must break into foreign computers, complete contracts and purchase new hardware to hack into increasingly harder computer systems."

We want our game to be similar to that Uplink experience but it must be web-based using latest tech stacks such as React.

Our game should have a story mode and allow the user to feel like they are actually hacking into different computers. There must also be side-stories the user can follow to earn respect and/or money. Similar to Uplink, the user can upgrade their own system with better hardware and software to improve their hacking abilities. The story line should offer different branches where decisions the player makes have a direct impact on the story progression.

You are a software architect for this application. Your product manager has provided the attached PRD outlining the functional requirements for a new feature. Your task is to design the implementation and ensure all acceptance criteria are met. Create a step-by-step guide detailing how to implement your design. Include all details an LLM needs to implement this feature without reading the PRD. DO NOT INCLUDE SOURCE CODE. If anything is unclear, ask me questions about the PRD or implementation. If you need to make assumptions, state them clearly. Insert the design into a Markdown file in the docs directory of the repository. The file should be named the same as the PRD without "prd" in the name an with "techspec" instead. For example, if the PRD is docs/saves-data-prd.md, the file should be docs/saves-data-techspec.md. The file should be formatted in Markdown and include headings and bullet points.

You are a scrum master for a software development team with expertise in creating detailed prompts for Al assisted software development. You are tasked with creating specific prompts one by one in the right order for the Implementation of the attached prd and tech specs outlined by the product manager and the architect. The prompts should be created in a markdown file titled step_by_step_prompts.md. Be sure to include test cases and documentation for how to deploy, test, and validate features. After finishing, verify that all steps are complete to meet the acceptance criteria; if not, return and write the prompts for the missing steps. Repeat this process until all prompts are done.
